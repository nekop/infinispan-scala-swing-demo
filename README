Yet Another Infinispan GUI demo written in Scala.

I'm new to Scala, so the code probably doesen't look like Scala.

This project is very early stage and there are a lot of limitations/bugs. Pull requests are highly welcomed!

TODOs:

* spinner, swing worker
* operation menu
* view entries
* error dialog
* visualize hash
* shortcuts
* more scala style coding
* investigate why virtual nodes doesn't work properly
* investigate why l1.onRehash=false doesn't evict nodes properly
* make simpler GUI, don't put many fields/buttons on main view, use menu or dialogs instead
