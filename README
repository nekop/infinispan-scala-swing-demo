Yet Another Infinispan GUI demo written in Scala.

I'm new to Scala, so the code probably doesen't look like Scala.

This project is very early stage and there are a lot of limitations/bugs. Pull requests are highly welcomed!

TODOs:

* kill all caches and cache panels
* auto resize cache bar capacity
* error dialog
* visualize hash
* fetch twitter stream into the cache
* runtime emulation. spawn threads that randomly insert/remove cache entries and start/stop caches
* shortcuts
* more scala style coding
* investigate why l1.onRehash=false doesn't evict nodes properly
  - https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1012

FAQs:

* Entry Count doubled.
  - It's because we have 1 backup copy for every entry, see hash.numOwners in infinispan-demo.xml.
* Entry Count shows stale/wrong value on rehash (during start/stop caches)
  - Right, this happens when l1 is enabled. If disabled some entries leak, so this is a limitation for now. Will investigate later.
