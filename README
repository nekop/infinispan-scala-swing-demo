Yet Another Infinispan GUI demo written in Scala.

I'm new to Scala, so the code probably doesen't look like Scala.

This project is very early stage and there are a lot of limitations/bugs. Pull requests are highly welcomed!

TODOs:

* view entries
* error dialog
* visualize hash
* fetch twitter stream into the cache
* runtime emulation. spawn a thread that randomly insert/remove cache entries
* shortcuts
* more scala style coding
* investigate why virtual nodes doesn't work properly
* investigate why l1.onRehash=false doesn't evict nodes properly

FAQs:

* Entry Count doubled.
  - It's because we have 1 backup copy for every entry, see hash.numOwners in infinispan-demo.xml.
* Entry Count shows stale/wrong value on rehash (during start/stop caches)
  - Right. The GUI is not strict here for performance reason. We don't want to block or synch caches.
